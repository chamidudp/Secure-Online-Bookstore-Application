Extensive bug fixing was conducted throughout the development process, supported by unit testing (TDD) with JUnit and automated testing with Selenium. Comprehensive technical documentation was created to detail the system architecture, security measures, and testing strategies, ensuring maintainability and scalability.

Technologies:

Front-end: React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Back-end: Spring Boot (Java), MySQL

Security: JWT for session management, bcrypt for password hashing, HTTPS
